# SpeakSavvy

SpeakSavvy is a language learning platform designed to help users practice and improve their language speaking skills. The application uses speech recognition to prompt users with sentences in the target language, and users are required to repeat the sentences accurately. The system evaluates the user's pronunciation and provides feedback, allowing them to refine their language skills.
How we built it
SpeakSavvy is built using a combination of technologies. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and interaction. Flask, a Python web framework, is used on the backend to handle server-side logic and communication with the Python scripts responsible for speech recognition and language prompts. The speech recognition functionality is implemented using the SpeechRecognition library in Python.
Challenges we ran into
1. Integration of Speech Recognition: Incorporating speech recognition into the
application posed challenges due to the need for precise recognition and accurate
evaluation of user speech.
2. Real-time Feedback: Providing real-time feedback on user pronunciation was a
challenge, as it required efficient communication between the frontend and backend
while maintaining a seamless user experience.
3. Language Prompt Selection: Dynamically selecting and presenting diverse language
prompts for users without making the process repetitive posed a creative challenge.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Speech Recognition Integration: Successfully integrating speech recognition
functionality into the application, allowing users to practice speaking in different
languages.
2. Real-time Feedback: Achieving real-time feedback on user pronunciation, enabling users
to receive immediate guidance on their language skills.
3. Diverse Language Prompts: Implementing a system that dynamically selects and
presents a variety of language prompts, enhancing the learning experience.
What we learned
1. Speech Recognition Techniques: We gained insights into the complexities and
techniques involved in implementing speech recognition for language learning
applications.
2. Web Development with Flask: Working with Flask for backend development provided
valuable experience in building web applications with Python.
3. User Experience Challenges: Addressing the challenges of providing an engaging and
effective user experience in language learning applications.
What's next for SpeakSavvy
1. Expanded Language Support: Adding support for additional languages to cater to a
broader audience.
2. Advanced Pronunciation Evaluation: Implementing more advanced algorithms to
evaluate pronunciation accuracy and provide detailed feedback.
3. User Progress Tracking: Developing a user profile system to track progress, set goals, and provide personalized language learning plans.
4. Interactive Lessons: Expanding the platform to include interactive lessons and conversations to further enhance language learning.
